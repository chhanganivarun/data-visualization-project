# Overview

## Development Finance since 2008

- Increasing debt vulnerablities of mid and low income countries
- Post 2008 seen rapid lending to them
  - Low intrest rates in high income countries (and thus, they would better invest where there is high interest rate)
  - buoyant commodity prices (and thus relatively more positive activity)
  - and quantitative easing (which further increases the buoyancy of the market)
- Several IDA(International Development Association)-only countries have observed highest increase in external debt
- In 2008-2018, over half of Sub Saharan countries observed double accumlation of debt as compared to previous decade
  - Ethopia observed 885% growth, 521% in Zambia, 437% for uganda, 395% for Ghana
  - Governments in these region have entered in International capital markets
    - EG: Ghana Eurobond entry in 2007
  - People have accumlated a lot in bonds
- Sustainable borrowing is good, but rapid increase in debt accoumlation imposes problems for borrowers, creditors and government.
