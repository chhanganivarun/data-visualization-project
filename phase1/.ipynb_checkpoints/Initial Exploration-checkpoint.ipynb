The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 5 percent. Principal repayments are actual amounts of principal (amortization) paid by the borrower in currency, goods, or services in the year specified. Data are in current U.S. dollars.\n",
