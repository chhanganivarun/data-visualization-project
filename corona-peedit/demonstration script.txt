India
NFL: bilateral, multilateral, others
India has been a part of development prorams of several countries in the past and also participated in multilateral ties for development in out of nation plans.

China has a cyclic habit of giving loan to poor countries in exchange of a long term lease or mortgage. China also has a record of confiscating territories for which countries took loan to develop.
